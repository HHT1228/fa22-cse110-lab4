# DevTools Part 2

1.  What was the bug?

    The input numbers are interpreted as strings and concatenated instead of performing arithmetic addition between the numeric values.

2.  How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use)

    I add the function ```Number()``` to ```num1``` and ```num2``` to force the conversion from string to numbers.
