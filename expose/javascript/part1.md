1. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why.

    ```values added: 20``` Since result, within the if block, equals to num1 + num2, which is 10 + 10 = 20.

2. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. 

    ```values added: 20``` Result is declares as ```var``` and is computed to be 20 inside the if block. Since var can be accessed regardless of the block, it is still 20 outside of the if block (inside of the function).
